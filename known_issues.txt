Judas - Grand Blue Dreaming S02E05 does not map to Grand Blue Season 2, but the overrdies can't change that becuase the episode numeration is correct and seasons are not accounted for.
When having multiple language versions like To Be Hero X, the app will download the first one since it doesn't differentiate CA and JP
Judas - does not support titles like "Isekai Mokushiroku Mynoghra (Apocalypse Bringer Mynoghra: World Conquest Starts with the Civilization of Ruin)"
Same with any other group that uses english title in parenthasies like "[Kaleido-subs] 9-nine- Shihaisha no Oukan (9-nine- Ruler's Crown) - 01 (S01E01) - (WEB 1080p HEVC x265 10-bit E-AC3) [C5867E58]"
Anilist - "Tensei shitara Dainana Ouji Datta node, Kimama ni Majutsu wo Kiwamemasu 2nd Season - 4" nie znajduje bo spacja "Dai nana"
